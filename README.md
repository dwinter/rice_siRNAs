##Homology between natually occuring siRNAs and human mRNAs

Recently there has been a bit of a fuss about the presence of 
dsRNA in some GMOs, with some even suggesting such molucules represent
a distinct threat to humans. 

[In one
case](http://www.inbi.canterbury.ac.nz/Documents/Reports%20and%20others/Heinemann-Report-20120828.pdf), the fact engineerd siRNAs could have homologies to human RNA transcipts has been been put forward as evidence for potential risk. Here, we will look such homologies in naturally occuring small RNAs from rice (sourced for [Lu etal 2012](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/721/abstract).
